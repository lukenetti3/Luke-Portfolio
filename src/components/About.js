          I care about writing clean and concise code. Writing software that is
          functional and directional is important to me. This website was built
          using GatsbyJS with the intent that speed and efficiency are vital. I
          have begun the process of branching to React and developing a skill
          set that is modern and current with web development trends.

          Hiring me will give your company a focused and attention to detail
          employee, looking to make the world a better place from behind a
          screen.
